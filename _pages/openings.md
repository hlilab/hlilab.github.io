# Open positions

We are currently looking for PhD students and postdocs who are interested in
developing high-performance algorithms for biological sequence analyses.
Potential projects include but not limited to: graph representation of multiple
genomes and its applications in calling genetic variations; assembly-based
lossy compression of resequencing data and variant calling; practical deep
learning models in cancer mutation calling; phasing with single-cell Hi-C data;
non-homogeneous methods to construct phylogenetic trees. We are also open to
other computational projects candidates would like to propose, as long as they
fit our general direction.

For the current openings, postdoc candicates should be proficient in
programming and have experiences in writing programs more than a few hundred
lines of code. Familarity with a high-performance language such as C/C++ is a
plus. If interested, please [email your CV](mailto:hli@jimmy.harvard.edu). Let
us know your GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket account if you have one.
