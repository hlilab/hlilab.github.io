Please [contact us](mailto:hli@ds.dfci.harvard.edu) if you are interested in
our group.

<!--
If you are interested in the following positions, please [email your
CV to us](mailto:hli@ds.dfci.harvard.edu). We are always open to potential
research projects proposed by the applicants. Also email us your research
plan if you have a project in your mind.

### Postdoc in computational biology

We are looking for a postdoc who is interested in bioinformatics and
computational biology. Potential research areas include but not limited to

* High-performance algorithms for sequence alignment and assembly
* Algorithms for the representation and application of pangenome data
* Methods for the detection and the analysis of somatic or de novo mutations
* Analysis of large-scale genomic data in the context of phylogenetics and population genetics

We are also open to potential research projects proposed by the candidates.

To apply for the position, a qualified candicate is expected to demonstrate a
strong background in biology, computer science or mathematics and have past
research experiences in bioinformatics and computational biology. The applicant
should be proficient in programming. Familarity with a high-performance
language such as C/C++/Rust may be a plus depending on the projects.

### Staff scientist on algorithm development

We are looking for a staff scientist who is interested in developing
high-performance algorithms for sequence alignment, de novo assembly, pangenome
representation, application of pangenome data structures or other projects the
applicant may propose. The candidate will focus on the development of new
algorithms but may maintain our existing tools sometimes.

To apply for the position, a qualified candidate is expected to be proficient
in a high-performance language such as C, C++ or Rust and have research
experiences in bioinformatics and computational biology.
