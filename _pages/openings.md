# Open positions

We are currently looking for PhD students and postdocs who are interested in
developing high-performance algorithms for biological sequence analyses.
Potential projects include but not limited to: sequence alignment, de novo
sequence assembly, graph representation of multiple genomes and its
applications in calling genetic variations, practical deep learning models in
bioinformatics and non-homogeneous methods to construct phylogenetic trees. We
are also open to other computational projects candidates would like to propose,
as long as they fit our general direction.

To apply for a position, a qualified candicate is expected to have a
strong background in at least one of the following fields: bioinformatics,
computational biology, computer science, mathematics or physics. The applicants
should be proficient in programming and have experiences in writing programs
more than a few hundred lines of code. Familarity with a high-performance
language such as C/C++/Rust is a plus. If interested, please [email your
CV](mailto:hli@ds.dfci.harvard.edu). Let us know your GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket
account if you have one.

A more complete job description can be found [under this link][jobad]. You can
still contact me even if this link expires. We often have openings.
