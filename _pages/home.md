The general theme of our research is to tackle biological problems with
advanced computational and statistical methods. We develop sophisticated
sequence alignment, sequence assembly and variant calling algorithms that are
fundamental to the applications of biological sequence data.  We analyze
single-cell sequence data to investigate mosaic between cells. We are also
interested in questions related to evolution, from species evolution over
hundreds of millions of years, to human evolution in the past hundreds of
thousands of years, all the way down to cell evolution in hundreds of cell
cycles.

We are part of the [department of Biomedical Informatics][dbmi] of Harvard
Medical School and the [department of Biostatistics & Computational
Biology][bcb] of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Our lab has collaborations with
the [Xie Research Group][xie], the [Reich lab][reich] and the [MacArthur
lab][macarthur] around the Boston area, as well as others elsewhere. Our work
is routinely used by thousands of researchers across the world. We are an
established young lab and **[are looking for](vacancies) passionate PhD
students and postdocs to join our team!**
