The general theme of our research is to tackle biological problems with
advanced computational and statistical methods. We develop sophisticated
algorithms for sequence alignment (e.g. [bwa][bwa], [minimap2][mm2] and
[chromap][cm]), sequence assembly (e.g. [miniasm][ma], [hifiasm][ha] and
[hifiasm-meta][hm]) and pangenome analysis (e.g. [minigraph][mg]). We design
widely used formats (e.g. [SAM][sam] and [GFA][gfa]) and also work on data
compression (e.g. [ropebwt2][rb2] and [bgt][bgt]), population genetics (e.g.
[PSMC][psmc]) and single-cell sequencing (e.g. [lianti][lianti]). Some of our
tools are essential to the applications of high-throughput sequence data and
among the most widely used in the field of bioinformatics. Please see our
[GitHub portal][github] for more tools we developed in recent years.

<!--
In the past, we have analyzed single-cell sequence data to investigate mosaic
between cells. We are also interested in questions related to evolution, from
species evolution over hundreds of millions of years, to human evolution in the
past hundreds of thousands of years, all the way down to cell evolution in
hundreds of cell cycles.

We are part of the [department of Biomedical Informatics][dbmi] of Harvard
Medical School and the [department of Data Science][ds] of Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute.
<!--
We are an established young lab and **[are looking for](vacancies)
passionate PhD students and postdocs to join our team!**
